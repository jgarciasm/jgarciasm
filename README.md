:rocket::rocket::rocket:

Graduated with honors from Software Engineering in 2015. I automatically went on to work as a university professor and taught classes in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Probability and Mathematical Statistics. I was working as a freelancer, programming backends in java and developing REST APIs for several startups from Spain. I have communication and leadership skills, I speak Spanish (native) and English (medium and professional technical level) 

I am a hard worker and love to learn and to teach others what I have learned. I would like to continue improving as a programmer and someday become a project manager.

I am a Christian and I really like to help other people, especially those in need. I am not very good at sports, but I like swimming and cycling very much. My favorite places are the sea and my house because I am very family oriented. I love making new friends and meeting people from different cultures.

I have experience in Java, C #, SQL, Javascript, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, VS Code, Mirth Connect, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Hibernate, ElasticSearch, Knime, Vert.x, JUnit, JMeter, Maven, Git, REST, SOAP, SoapUI, Postman, Swagger, JasperReport...
